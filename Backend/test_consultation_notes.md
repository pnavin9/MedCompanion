# Consultation Notes - Cardiology

## Patient: John Doe (MRN-123456)
## Date: January 12, 2026
## Provider: Dr. Sarah Smith, MD - Cardiology

### Reason for Consultation
Patient referred by primary care physician for evaluation of:
1. Occasional shortness of breath on exertion
2. Intermittent palpitations
3. Risk stratification given diabetes and hypertension

### History of Present Illness
59-year-old male with history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension presents for cardiology evaluation. Patient reports:
- Dyspnea on exertion, primarily when climbing stairs or walking uphill
- Episodes began approximately 3 months ago
- Denies chest pain, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
- Occasional sensation of "heart racing" lasting 30-60 seconds
- No syncope or pre-syncope
- No lower extremity edema

### Physical Examination
- **Vital Signs**:
  - BP: 132/84 mmHg (seated)
  - HR: 76 bpm, regular
  - RR: 16 breaths/min
  - SpO2: 98% on room air
  - Weight: 195 lbs, Height: 5'10"
  - BMI: 28.0 kg/m² (overweight)

- **Cardiovascular**:
  - Regular rate and rhythm
  - Normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
  - No jugular venous distention
  - Peripheral pulses 2+ and symmetric
  - No peripheral edema

- **Respiratory**:
  - Clear to auscultation bilaterally
  - No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi
  - Good air movement

### Diagnostic Studies Ordered

#### Electrocardiogram (ECG)
- Normal sinus rhythm
- Rate: 74 bpm
- Normal axis
- No ST-T wave abnormalities
- No evidence of prior MI
- **Interpretation**: Normal ECG

#### Echocardiogram (Scheduled)
Transthoracic echocardiogram ordered to assess:
- Left ventricular function and ejection fraction
- Valvular function
- Chamber sizes
- Diastolic function

#### Exercise Stress Test (Scheduled)
Bruce protocol stress test ordered to evaluate:
- Exercise capacity
- Presence of inducible ischemia
- Blood pressure response to exercise
- Arrhythmias with exertion

### Assessment
1. **Dyspnea on exertion** - Likely multifactorial
   - Differential diagnosis:
     - Deconditioning (most likely given exercise history)
     - Early heart failure (less likely, no other signs)
     - Coronary artery disease (moderate risk given DM, HTN, smoking history)
     - Pulmonary causes (less likely)

2. **Palpitations** - Likely benign
   - Brief, self-limiting episodes
   - No associated symptoms
   - Consider 24-hour Holter monitoring if persistent

3. **Cardiovascular Risk Factors**
   - Multiple risk factors present:
     - Type 2 Diabetes
     - Hypertension
     - Former smoker
     - Borderline dyslipidemia
     - Family history of heart disease
   - 10-year ASCVD risk: approximately 15% (intermediate risk)

### Plan
1. **Diagnostic workup**:
   - Echocardiogram (scheduled for Jan 20, 2026)
   - Exercise stress test (scheduled for Jan 25, 2026)
   - Consider 24-hour Holter monitor if palpitations persist

2. **Medical management**:
   - Continue current antihypertensive therapy (Lisinopril)
   - Continue aspirin for cardiovascular protection
   - **New**: Start Atorvastatin 20mg daily for dyslipidemia and cardiovascular risk reduction
   - Optimize diabetes control in collaboration with PCP

3. **Lifestyle modifications**:
   - Encourage gradual increase in aerobic exercise
   - Target: 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise 5 days/week
   - Cardiac rehabilitation program may be beneficial
   - Weight loss goal: 10-15 lbs
   - Heart-healthy diet (Mediterranean or DASH diet)

4. **Follow-up**:
   - Return to cardiology clinic after completion of diagnostic studies
   - Will discuss findings and further management
   - Call clinic immediately if chest pain, severe dyspnea, or syncope occur

### Prognosis
Overall good prognosis with appropriate risk factor modification and adherence to treatment plan. Will reassess after diagnostic studies are complete.
