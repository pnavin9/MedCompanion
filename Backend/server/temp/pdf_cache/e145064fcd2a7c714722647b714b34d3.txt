Interpretations
1. HbA1C has been endorsed by clinical groups and American Diabetes Association guidelines 2017 for diagnosing diabetes using a cut off
point of 6.5%
2. Low glycated haemoglobin in a non diabetic individual are often associated with systemic inflammatory diseases, chronic anaemia
(especially severe iron deficiency and haemolytic), chronic renal failure and liver diseases.  Clinical correlation suggested.
3. In known diabetic patients, following values can be considered as a tool for monitoring the glycemic control.
     Excellent control-6-7 %
    Fair to Good control – 7-8 %
    Unsatisfactory control – 8 to 10 %
    Poor Control – More than 10 %

Interpretation
This test is useful for assessing the risk of developing Myocardial Infarction in patients having acute coronary syndromes and assessing the
risk of developing cardiovascular disease in asymptomatic individuals. A single test for high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) may not reflect an
individual patient's basal hs-CRP level. Repeat measurement may be required to firmly establish an individual's basal hs-CRP concentration.
Because CRP is an acute-phase reactant, measurements in apparently healthy individuals may not truly reflect the basal level if inflammation
is present.

Interpretation :
• Determination of Lp(a) may be useful to guide management of individuals with a family history of Coronary heart disease (CHD)
 • Elevated concentration of Lp(a) are a risk factor for CHD.
• Serum concentration of Lp(a) are related to generic factors and are largely unaffected by diet, exercise and lipid lowering pharmaceuticals.
• However ,in patients with additional modifiable CHD risk factor, more aggressive therapy to normalize these factors may be indicated if the
Lp(a) value is also increased-

illness(acute severe illness or chronic illness), central hypothyroidism, confounding medications.

Interpretation:
Vitamin B12, also known as cyanocobalamin, is a water soluble vitamin that is required for the maturation of erythrocytes and coenzyme form
for more than 12 different enzyme systems. Groupsat risk for vitamin B12 deficiency include those
(1) older than 65 years of age (2) with malabsorption(3) who are vegetarians (4) with autoimmune disorders(5) taking prescribedmedication 
known to interfere with vitamin absorption or metabolism, including nitrous oxide, phenytoin, dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors, metformin,

The most common cause of Vitamin B12 deficiency is pernicious anemia. Deficiency of Vitamin B12 is associated with megaloblastic anemia
and neuropathy. Excess Vitamin B12 is excreted in urine. No adverse effects have been associated with excess vitamin B12 intake from food
or supplements in healthy people.

Useful for :
Diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency .
Differential diagnosis of causes of rickets and Osteomalacia . Monitoring vitamin D replacement therapy . Diagnosis of hypervitaminosis D .
Vitamin D levels may vary according to factors such as geography, season, or the patient’s health, diet, age, ethnic origin, use of vitamin D
supplementation or environment.
Some potential interfering substances like rheumatoid factor, endogenous alkaline phosphatase, fibrin, and proteins capable of binding to
alkaline phosphatase in the patient sample may cause erroneous results in immunoassays.Carefully evaluate the results of patients
suspected of having these types of interferences.

Non –Reactive  :  <   0.80

Interpretation:
The test is a qualitative test. The test is used for the qualitative detection of immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to evaluate the
immune response to the virus.
The SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay results, in conjunction with clinical presentation and the results of other laboratory tests, is used as an aid for the
laboratory assessment of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
For assessing the antibody titre post vaccination and post infection, it is recommended to do the test, IgG antibody against S1, Spike protein
