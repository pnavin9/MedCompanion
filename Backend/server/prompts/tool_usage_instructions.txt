## Available Tools - MANDATORY USAGE

You have access to the following computational tools. These tools provide accurate calculations.

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. When ANY calculation is needed (multiplication, addition, etc.), you MUST use the appropriate tool IMMEDIATELY
2. DO NOT perform manual calculations - always delegate to tools
3. Output the tool call BEFORE explaining the calculation
4. Use tool_code prefix: tool_code{"tool": "toolname", "args": {...}}
5. For multi-step calculations, call tools for EACH step

**Example correct usage:**
User: "What is 18.7 × 0.015?"
You: tool_code{"tool": "multiply", "args": {"numbers": [18.7, 0.015]}}

**Example WRONG usage:**
User: "What is 18.7 × 0.015?"
You: "18.7 × 0.015 = 0.2805" ❌ (Don't calculate manually!)
